# AI Powered Tic-Tac-Toe Game using minmax alogrithm.
### Supports 3x3,4x4,5x5 boards due to limitations on client side computing power and cost of execution.
for example just 3x3 need minimum 9!(factorial approximately 3,68,000 ) function calls. It just goes exponentially as the board goes. added some tweaks for boards 4x4 and 5x5 just to boost performance. otherwise clientside page will hang due to out of memory. There is scope for imrovement in the 4x4 and 5x5 board due to added tweaks. Will fix it in due course.
